Hi,
this is a free math parser, that I started for some studies.

The supported operations are:
-> + (Sum)
-> - (Subtraction)
-> * (Multiplication)
-> / (Division)
-> ^ (Potenciation)

The variables MUST start with a LETTER(A-z) or UNDERLINE(_) and can have numbers from the second character.

PUBLIC METHODS:
-> Constructor(exp) = expression that will be evaluated.
-> setVariable(variable, value) = Create (if not exists) or change a variable value.
-> changeExpression(exp) = changes expression that will be evaluated.
-> evaluate() = evaluate the expression with the variables values.
